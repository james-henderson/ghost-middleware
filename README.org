* Ghost

Some really lightweight middleware to implement Google's AJAX crawling
specification [[https://developers.google.com/webmasters/ajax-crawling/][(specification here)]]

Essentially, Google will index a URL with a hash-fragment by
extracting the fragment and passing it as a query parameter. So - to
index http://example.com/#key=value, the GoogleBot will request
http://example.com/?_escaped_fragment=key%3Dvalue. 

** Installation

Add the following to your lein project.clj:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  [jarohen/ghost-middleware "0.1.0"]
#+END_SRC

You also need an installation of [[http://phantomjs.org][phantomjs]] - the easiest way to
install this is using =npm=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  npm install phantomjs
#+END_SRC

** Setting up

Wrap any routes that you wish the crawler to index with =wrap-shebang=:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
  (:require [ghost.middleware :refer [wrap-shebang]])
  
  (defroutes your-routes
    (GET "/" []
      (response (home-page)))
    ...)
  
  (defn app []
    (-> (your-routes)
        wrap-shebang))
  
#+END_SRC

** HtmlUnit

I tried previously to get this working with [[http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/][HtmlUnit]] - although failed
because it was very particular about the JS it would accept (i.e. it
rejected JavaScript that ran perfectly fine in the browser - see [[http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/javascript.html][this
article]] for more details)

If you have  any experience with this,  please let me know  - I'd much
rather use a Java headless browser than shelling out!

** Bugs/features/suggestions/questions?

Please feel free to submit bug reports/patches etc through the GitHub
repository in the usual way!

Thanks!
